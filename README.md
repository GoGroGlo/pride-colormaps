# Pride Colormaps
Matplotlib colormaps inspired by pride flags!

This seeks to cover as many LGBTQIA+ pride flags as possible while still being useful for plotting in Matplotlib. 

## This is a work in progress
I just started this project as a way to learn Python by doing it, so the changes will be incremental. Stay tuned!
